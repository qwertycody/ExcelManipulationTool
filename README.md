# Excel Manipulation Tool
Skeleton application with a launcher that demonstrates how to manipulate Excel files using the ClosedXML framework

Usage:
1.  Open Solution (*.sln) file
2.  Run the build in debug if debugging, Release if ready to hand out final exe
3.  By default testMode is set to true under Main.cs to demo the app end-to-end, set it to false if wanted.
4.  When building final exe for hand out, be sure app is set to release mode at top in visual studio then click build solution, navigate to the solution directory, launcher directory, bin, release and the final exe that is there is all that is needed to hand out for a one-click executable.
5.  Optional - probably rename the exe and stuff before handing off?
6.  Probably don't modify the launcher unless you understand how embedding resources work in visual studio? not really a big deal, but shoot me an email at cody@garrett.ms with any questions if needed.
